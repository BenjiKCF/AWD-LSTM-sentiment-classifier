       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

       "xxbos i was seven when i first watched this movie and am still captivated by it as a 26 year - old . xxmaj this may sound corny , but i really love the movie 's theme song , \" i xxmaj have the xxmaj power \" . \" xxmaj he - xxmaj man \" and \" xxmaj she - xxmaj ra \" were likely xxup the defining cartoons of the 1980s , yet i have heard of no plans to release the film on xxup dvd . i taped the movie from the xxup usa cable network in 1989 , and - as one might imagine - the quality of the tape has deteriorated . xxmaj it 's still watchable , but not quite up to my standards . xxmaj oh how i wish i could find even a decent second - hand xxup vhs copy , to replace my failing one ! i tried watching the new xxmaj he - xxmaj man series on the xxmaj cartoon xxmaj network , but it simply does not compare to the original .,xxbos xxmaj yay ! ... i think . xxmaj it 's hard to say . xxmaj it 's hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion . xxmaj this movie is as sterile as a surgeon 's scalpel . xxmaj for a setting , it has a few stone pillars , some stone seats , a couple stone crosses and some stone actors . xxmaj they have no emotion ! xxmaj the only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is xxmaj hamlet , and xxmaj hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature . xxmaj the dubbing really was n't all that bad though . xxmaj the voices stuck true to the dull , gloomy , dreary , life - sucking atmosphere the movie gave forth . i have seen this version of xxmaj hamlet on the fabulous xxmaj mystery xxmaj science xxmaj theater 3000 three times , and each of the three times , i was on the brink of turning off the xxup tv , despite it being xxup mst xxup xxunk \n",

       "  xxmaj not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better .,xxbos xxmaj the efforts of a new group of young talent bolstered by xxmaj alan xxmaj rickman and xxmaj emma xxmaj thompson , 2 extremely gifted actors , makes for a thrilling and engrossing evening of entertainment . xxmaj and i might add that xxmaj hal xxmaj holbrook shines as the xxmaj senator . xxmaj this movie deserves five stars . i give it a ten on your scale . xxmaj and the ending is xxup perfect . i am constantly amazed at the ability of xxmaj british actors to master our xxmaj american accents . i was convinced that all the actors were born in xxmaj louisiana . xxmaj and what finer locale for a mystery than xxmaj new xxmaj orleans ! xxmaj the xxmaj big xxmaj easy , also known as the xxmaj crescent xxmaj city , permeates every scene . xxmaj as writer and director , xxmaj sebastian xxmaj gutierrez deserves high praise .,xxbos xxmaj first of all , this plot is way overdone - girl wants to make it , everyone loves her , snobby girl intervenes , all looks lost , girl pulls through , everyone loves her again etc . xxmaj throw in the fitting in thing , an attractive male crushing on the heroine , plus single - parent troubles and it 's so predictable that you can practically recite along with it . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj second of all , i really hate how they keep on dissing classical music . xxmaj they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close - minded - in fact , i do n't recall the quote exactly , but i remember at one point in the movie , xxmaj holly says , \" xxmaj why do they have to be so uptight ... so classical ? \" xxmaj it 's really insulting how label classical music in this way . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj third , i 've went over it dozens of times , but the only reason that i can think of for making this movie is to promote xxmaj britney xxmaj spears . there just is n't any point at all . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj and oh yeah , while the actress who portrayed xxmaj holly ( i 'm not sure whether that was really her singing or not ) had a reasonably good voice , it was n't as amazing as they were making it out to be - especially when she was belting . xxmaj she was xxunk the whole time . \n",
       " \n",
       "  1 / 10 stars .,xxbos xxmaj this movie is a little unusual in that it 's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace . xxmaj while this makes it pretty different from the average xxmaj grant film , it is still highly watchable and entertaining . xxmaj it 's sort of like someone said \" let 's just follow xxmaj cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house xxunk \" . xxmaj considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from xxmaj myrna xxmaj loy and xxmaj melvin xxmaj douglas , the film works very well . xxmaj while the film has pretty modest pretensions , it makes the most of the material . xxmaj it 's a great film for xxmaj cary xxmaj grant fans or for the whole family .\n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj even for sitcoms , this was the most implausible plot since xxmaj ron xxmaj xxunk starting spray painting bald men .,xxbos xxmaj there are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad xxmaj valentine that i do n't know where to begin . i will say this though ; here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the xxmaj valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school . xxmaj you know , the ones with xxmaj batman exclaiming \" xxmaj you 're a super crime - fighting valentine ! \" \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony , one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of xxmaj scream . xxmaj the villain is omniscient and nigh - invulnerable . xxmaj the heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming \" xxunk ! \" xxmaj the score is more overbearing than xxmaj norman xxmaj bates ' mother . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the flimsy plot follows several childhood friends , now grown up and extremely curvaceous . xxmaj since the film gives them nothing else to do , they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one . xxmaj this stalker appears to be former nerd xxmaj jeremy xxmaj melton , who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school . xxmaj with xxmaj valentine 's xxmaj day approaching , the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom . xxmaj melton seems like the obvious suspect . xxmaj only problem is , as numerous characters warns , in thirteen years xxmaj melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome . xxmaj so ( insert terrified gasp here ) everyone is a suspect ! \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj here 's problem one . xxmaj in order to have any sense of suspense while watching xxmaj valentine , you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming xxmaj david xxmaj boreanaz . xxmaj nerds do n't turn into xxmaj angel when they grown up , they turn into older , xxunk nerds . xxmaj he 's not a terrible actor , but the script , by no less than four writers , gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out . xxmaj denise xxmaj richards ( the xxunk actress in xxmaj hollywood never to star in xxmaj baywatch ) is especially exploited ; most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene . xxmaj note to self : always bring a bathing suit to a xxmaj valentine 's xxmaj day party . xxmaj just because it 's xxmaj february does n't mean you might not feel like taking a little dip . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the slasher in xxmaj valentine dresses in head - to - toe black with a xxmaj cherub 's mask . xxmaj here 's problem number two . xxmaj the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who 's whacking people in the face with hot irons . xxmaj plain and simple , it 's not . xxmaj instead , it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face , including his eyes and ears , can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables . xxmaj then again , given the things the xxmaj cupid xxmaj killer does , maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj not only is the movie bad , it is n't even sure who the killer is ; the final \" twist \" is more \" xxmaj huh ? \" than \" xxmaj hah ! \" xxmaj when you 're not scratching your head you 're yawning , then groaning , then searching for the nearest exit . xxmaj do not watch this movie . xxmaj even if you 're alone on xxmaj valentine 's xxmaj day , find something , xxup anything , else to do . xxmaj you 'll be glad you did .,xxbos xxmaj when someone remakes a classic movie , the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original . xxmaj also , there 's a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj well , the 1973 xxup tv version of \" xxmaj double xxmaj indemnity \" has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original . xxmaj the main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all . xxmaj fred macmurray was great as the lecherous , leering insurance agent xxmaj walter xxmaj neff in the original ; xxmaj richard xxmaj crenna just seems world - weary and tired . xxmaj edward xxup g. xxmaj robinson brought great manic energy to his role as macmurray 's boss xxmaj barton xxmaj keys ; xxmaj lee xxup j. xxmaj cobb , a fine actor , appears almost bored with the proceedings . xxmaj samantha xxmaj eggar is all wrong as the conniving , back - stabbing xxmaj phyllis xxmaj dietrichson ; while xxmaj barbara xxmaj stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role , xxmaj eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place . \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj however , after the movie starts , the whole thing just sort of lies there , without any life or electricity . xxmaj this is one film that never should have been remade .,xxbos xxmaj please xxmaj note : i see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film . i saw the sound version and it was esthetically xxunk . xxmaj considering some indicate that the original version was xxup longer and without crappy dubbing , my review must be read with this in mind . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj although i know that xxmaj rene xxmaj clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and xxmaj louise xxmaj brooks has a bit of a cult following as well , this is in many ways a technically poorly made film . xxmaj while xxmaj hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929 , up through the early to almost the mid-30s , a lot of famous xxmaj french films were essentially silent films -- with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film . xxmaj the lip movements in many , and in particular this film , do n't even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an xxmaj american like xxmaj ms. xxmaj brooks could do a xxmaj french film . xxmaj this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent film -- and as a silent film this is would have been an average film -- with excellent camera work ( at times ) and some decent silent - style acting . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot . xxmaj for a silent morality play circa 1920 , it would have been fine , but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary ( that means \" old \"-- not \" slutty \" ) . a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé ca n't handle it . xxmaj she gives it all up , temporarily , but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end ! a tad melodramatic , huh ? xxmaj and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj finally , the character of the fiancé 's friend ( ? ) i found very disturbing and unreal . xxmaj he looked like xxmaj harold xxmaj lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else . xxmaj as he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about , his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean - spirited . xxmaj were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused ? xxmaj this seems to me that 's what is implied and i do n't like it at all . \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony , one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of xxmaj scream . xxmaj the villain is omniscient and nigh - invulnerable . xxmaj the heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming \" xxunk ! \" xxmaj the score is more overbearing than xxmaj norman xxmaj bates ' mother . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the flimsy plot follows several childhood friends , now grown up and extremely curvaceous . xxmaj since the film gives them nothing else to do , they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one . xxmaj this stalker appears to be former nerd xxmaj jeremy xxmaj melton , who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school . xxmaj with xxmaj valentine 's xxmaj day approaching , the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom . xxmaj melton seems like the obvious suspect . xxmaj only problem is , as numerous characters warns , in thirteen years xxmaj melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome . xxmaj so ( insert terrified gasp here ) everyone is a suspect ! \n",

       "  xxmaj here 's problem one . xxmaj in order to have any sense of suspense while watching xxmaj valentine , you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming xxmaj david xxmaj boreanaz . xxmaj nerds do n't turn into xxmaj angel when they grown up , they turn into older , xxunk nerds . xxmaj he 's not a terrible actor , but the script , by no less than four writers , gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out . xxmaj denise xxmaj richards ( the xxunk actress in xxmaj hollywood never to star in xxmaj baywatch ) is especially exploited ; most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene . xxmaj note to self : always bring a bathing suit to a xxmaj valentine 's xxmaj day party . xxmaj just because it 's xxmaj february does n't mean you might not feel like taking a little dip . \n",

       "  xxmaj the slasher in xxmaj valentine dresses in head - to - toe black with a xxmaj cherub 's mask . xxmaj here 's problem number two . xxmaj the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who 's whacking people in the face with hot irons . xxmaj plain and simple , it 's not . xxmaj instead , it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face , including his eyes and ears , can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables . xxmaj then again , given the things the xxmaj cupid xxmaj killer does , maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj not only is the movie bad , it is n't even sure who the killer is ; the final \" twist \" is more \" xxmaj huh ? \" than \" xxmaj hah ! \" xxmaj when you 're not scratching your head you 're yawning , then groaning , then searching for the nearest exit . xxmaj do not watch this movie . xxmaj even if you 're alone on xxmaj valentine 's xxmaj day , find something , xxup anything , else to do . xxmaj you 'll be glad you did .,xxbos xxmaj when someone remakes a classic movie , the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original . xxmaj also , there 's a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj well , the 1973 xxup tv version of \" xxmaj double xxmaj indemnity \" has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original . xxmaj the main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all . xxmaj fred macmurray was great as the lecherous , leering insurance agent xxmaj walter xxmaj neff in the original ; xxmaj richard xxmaj crenna just seems world - weary and tired . xxmaj edward xxup g. xxmaj robinson brought great manic energy to his role as macmurray 's boss xxmaj barton xxmaj keys ; xxmaj lee xxup j. xxmaj cobb , a fine actor , appears almost bored with the proceedings . xxmaj samantha xxmaj eggar is all wrong as the conniving , back - stabbing xxmaj phyllis xxmaj dietrichson ; while xxmaj barbara xxmaj stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role , xxmaj eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place . \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj however , after the movie starts , the whole thing just sort of lies there , without any life or electricity . xxmaj this is one film that never should have been remade .,xxbos xxmaj please xxmaj note : i see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film . i saw the sound version and it was esthetically xxunk . xxmaj considering some indicate that the original version was xxup longer and without crappy dubbing , my review must be read with this in mind . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj although i know that xxmaj rene xxmaj clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and xxmaj louise xxmaj brooks has a bit of a cult following as well , this is in many ways a technically poorly made film . xxmaj while xxmaj hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929 , up through the early to almost the mid-30s , a lot of famous xxmaj french films were essentially silent films -- with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film . xxmaj the lip movements in many , and in particular this film , do n't even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an xxmaj american like xxmaj ms. xxmaj brooks could do a xxmaj french film . xxmaj this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent film -- and as a silent film this is would have been an average film -- with excellent camera work ( at times ) and some decent silent - style acting . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot . xxmaj for a silent morality play circa 1920 , it would have been fine , but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary ( that means \" old \"-- not \" slutty \" ) . a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé ca n't handle it . xxmaj she gives it all up , temporarily , but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end ! a tad melodramatic , huh ? xxmaj and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj finally , the character of the fiancé 's friend ( ? ) i found very disturbing and unreal . xxmaj he looked like xxmaj harold xxmaj lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else . xxmaj as he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about , his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean - spirited . xxmaj were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused ? xxmaj this seems to me that 's what is implied and i do n't like it at all . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj there are xxup far better xxmaj french films of the era ( xxmaj le xxmaj million , xxmaj la xxmaj femme du xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj fanny , xxmaj regain , and others ) as well as better silent films . i just ca n't understand this film 's high rating .,xxbos xxmaj luise xxmaj rainer received an xxmaj oscar for her performance in xxmaj the xxmaj good xxmaj earth . xxmaj unfortunately , her role required no . xxmaj she did not say much and looked pale throughout the film . xxmaj luise 's character was a slave then given away to marriage to xxmaj paul xxmaj muni 's character ( he did a fantastic job for his performance ) . xxmaj set in ancient xxmaj asia , both actors were not xxmaj asian , but were very convincing in their roles . i hope that xxmaj paul xxmaj muni received an xxmaj oscar for his performance , because that is what xxmaj luise must have gotten her xxmaj oscar for . xxmaj she must have been a breakthrough actress , one of the first to method act . xxmaj this seems like something that xxmaj hollywood does often . xxmaj al xxmaj pacino has played an xxmaj italian and xxmaj cuban . i felt xxmaj luise 's performance to be lackluster throughout , and when she died , she did not change in expression from any previous scenes . xxmaj she stayed the same throughout the film ; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice . xxmaj if her brilliant acting was so subtle , i suppose i did not see it .\n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot . xxmaj for a silent morality play circa 1920 , it would have been fine , but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary ( that means \" old \"-- not \" slutty \" ) . a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé ca n't handle it . xxmaj she gives it all up , temporarily , but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end ! a tad melodramatic , huh ? xxmaj and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped . \n",

       "  xxmaj the slasher in xxmaj valentine dresses in head - to - toe black with a xxmaj cherub 's mask . xxmaj here 's problem number two . xxmaj the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who 's whacking people in the face with hot irons . xxmaj plain and simple , it 's not . xxmaj instead , it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face , including his eyes and ears , can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables . xxmaj then again , given the things the xxmaj cupid xxmaj killer does , maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj not only is the movie bad , it is n't even sure who the killer is ; the final \" twist \" is more \" xxmaj huh ? \" than \" xxmaj hah ! \" xxmaj when you 're not scratching your head you 're yawning , then groaning , then searching for the nearest exit . xxmaj do not watch this movie . xxmaj even if you 're alone on xxmaj valentine 's xxmaj day , find something , xxup anything , else to do . xxmaj you 'll be glad you did .,xxbos xxmaj when someone remakes a classic movie , the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original . xxmaj also , there 's a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj well , the 1973 xxup tv version of \" xxmaj double xxmaj indemnity \" has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original . xxmaj the main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all . xxmaj fred macmurray was great as the lecherous , leering insurance agent xxmaj walter xxmaj neff in the original ; xxmaj richard xxmaj crenna just seems world - weary and tired . xxmaj edward xxup g. xxmaj robinson brought great manic energy to his role as macmurray 's boss xxmaj barton xxmaj keys ; xxmaj lee xxup j. xxmaj cobb , a fine actor , appears almost bored with the proceedings . xxmaj samantha xxmaj eggar is all wrong as the conniving , back - stabbing xxmaj phyllis xxmaj dietrichson ; while xxmaj barbara xxmaj stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role , xxmaj eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place . \n",

       "  xxmaj robert xxmaj webber , in the old xxmaj richard xxmaj gaines role as xxmaj robinson 's boss xxmaj norton , and xxmaj john xxmaj fiedler taking the xxmaj porter xxmaj hall role as the crucial witness , bring some life to the movie . xxmaj in particular , xxmaj webber recreates the xxmaj norton role well in a 1970s context . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj however , after the movie starts , the whole thing just sort of lies there , without any life or electricity . xxmaj this is one film that never should have been remade .,xxbos xxmaj please xxmaj note : i see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film . i saw the sound version and it was esthetically xxunk . xxmaj considering some indicate that the original version was xxup longer and without crappy dubbing , my review must be read with this in mind . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj although i know that xxmaj rene xxmaj clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and xxmaj louise xxmaj brooks has a bit of a cult following as well , this is in many ways a technically poorly made film . xxmaj while xxmaj hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929 , up through the early to almost the mid-30s , a lot of famous xxmaj french films were essentially silent films -- with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film . xxmaj the lip movements in many , and in particular this film , do n't even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an xxmaj american like xxmaj ms. xxmaj brooks could do a xxmaj french film . xxmaj this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent film -- and as a silent film this is would have been an average film -- with excellent camera work ( at times ) and some decent silent - style acting . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot . xxmaj for a silent morality play circa 1920 , it would have been fine , but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary ( that means \" old \"-- not \" slutty \" ) . a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé ca n't handle it . xxmaj she gives it all up , temporarily , but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end ! a tad melodramatic , huh ? xxmaj and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj finally , the character of the fiancé 's friend ( ? ) i found very disturbing and unreal . xxmaj he looked like xxmaj harold xxmaj lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else . xxmaj as he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about , his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean - spirited . xxmaj were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused ? xxmaj this seems to me that 's what is implied and i do n't like it at all . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj there are xxup far better xxmaj french films of the era ( xxmaj le xxmaj million , xxmaj la xxmaj femme du xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj fanny , xxmaj regain , and others ) as well as better silent films . i just ca n't understand this film 's high rating .,xxbos xxmaj luise xxmaj rainer received an xxmaj oscar for her performance in xxmaj the xxmaj good xxmaj earth . xxmaj unfortunately , her role required no . xxmaj she did not say much and looked pale throughout the film . xxmaj luise 's character was a slave then given away to marriage to xxmaj paul xxmaj muni 's character ( he did a fantastic job for his performance ) . xxmaj set in ancient xxmaj asia , both actors were not xxmaj asian , but were very convincing in their roles . i hope that xxmaj paul xxmaj muni received an xxmaj oscar for his performance , because that is what xxmaj luise must have gotten her xxmaj oscar for . xxmaj she must have been a breakthrough actress , one of the first to method act . xxmaj this seems like something that xxmaj hollywood does often . xxmaj al xxmaj pacino has played an xxmaj italian and xxmaj cuban . i felt xxmaj luise 's performance to be lackluster throughout , and when she died , she did not change in expression from any previous scenes . xxmaj she stayed the same throughout the film ; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice . xxmaj if her brilliant acting was so subtle , i suppose i did not see it .\n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony , one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of xxmaj scream . xxmaj the villain is omniscient and nigh - invulnerable . xxmaj the heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming \" xxunk ! \" xxmaj the score is more overbearing than xxmaj norman xxmaj bates ' mother . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the flimsy plot follows several childhood friends , now grown up and extremely curvaceous . xxmaj since the film gives them nothing else to do , they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one . xxmaj this stalker appears to be former nerd xxmaj jeremy xxmaj melton , who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school . xxmaj with xxmaj valentine 's xxmaj day approaching , the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom . xxmaj melton seems like the obvious suspect . xxmaj only problem is , as numerous characters warns , in thirteen years xxmaj melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome . xxmaj so ( insert terrified gasp here ) everyone is a suspect ! \n",

       "  xxmaj here 's problem one . xxmaj in order to have any sense of suspense while watching xxmaj valentine , you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming xxmaj david xxmaj boreanaz . xxmaj nerds do n't turn into xxmaj angel when they grown up , they turn into older , xxunk nerds . xxmaj he 's not a terrible actor , but the script , by no less than four writers , gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out . xxmaj denise xxmaj richards ( the xxunk actress in xxmaj hollywood never to star in xxmaj baywatch ) is especially exploited ; most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene . xxmaj note to self : always bring a bathing suit to a xxmaj valentine 's xxmaj day party . xxmaj just because it 's xxmaj february does n't mean you might not feel like taking a little dip . \n",

       "  xxmaj the slasher in xxmaj valentine dresses in head - to - toe black with a xxmaj cherub 's mask . xxmaj here 's problem number two . xxmaj the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who 's whacking people in the face with hot irons . xxmaj plain and simple , it 's not . xxmaj instead , it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face , including his eyes and ears , can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables . xxmaj then again , given the things the xxmaj cupid xxmaj killer does , maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj not only is the movie bad , it is n't even sure who the killer is ; the final \" twist \" is more \" xxmaj huh ? \" than \" xxmaj hah ! \" xxmaj when you 're not scratching your head you 're yawning , then groaning , then searching for the nearest exit . xxmaj do not watch this movie . xxmaj even if you 're alone on xxmaj valentine 's xxmaj day , find something , xxup anything , else to do . xxmaj you 'll be glad you did .,xxbos xxmaj when someone remakes a classic movie , the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original . xxmaj also , there 's a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj well , the 1973 xxup tv version of \" xxmaj double xxmaj indemnity \" has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original . xxmaj the main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all . xxmaj fred macmurray was great as the lecherous , leering insurance agent xxmaj walter xxmaj neff in the original ; xxmaj richard xxmaj crenna just seems world - weary and tired . xxmaj edward xxup g. xxmaj robinson brought great manic energy to his role as macmurray 's boss xxmaj barton xxmaj keys ; xxmaj lee xxup j. xxmaj cobb , a fine actor , appears almost bored with the proceedings . xxmaj samantha xxmaj eggar is all wrong as the conniving , back - stabbing xxmaj phyllis xxmaj dietrichson ; while xxmaj barbara xxmaj stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role , xxmaj eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place . \n",

       "  xxmaj however , after the movie starts , the whole thing just sort of lies there , without any life or electricity . xxmaj this is one film that never should have been remade .,xxbos xxmaj please xxmaj note : i see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film . i saw the sound version and it was esthetically xxunk . xxmaj considering some indicate that the original version was xxup longer and without crappy dubbing , my review must be read with this in mind . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj although i know that xxmaj rene xxmaj clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and xxmaj louise xxmaj brooks has a bit of a cult following as well , this is in many ways a technically poorly made film . xxmaj while xxmaj hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929 , up through the early to almost the mid-30s , a lot of famous xxmaj french films were essentially silent films -- with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film . xxmaj the lip movements in many , and in particular this film , do n't even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an xxmaj american like xxmaj ms. xxmaj brooks could do a xxmaj french film . xxmaj this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent film -- and as a silent film this is would have been an average film -- with excellent camera work ( at times ) and some decent silent - style acting . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot . xxmaj for a silent morality play circa 1920 , it would have been fine , but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary ( that means \" old \"-- not \" slutty \" ) . a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé ca n't handle it . xxmaj she gives it all up , temporarily , but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end ! a tad melodramatic , huh ? xxmaj and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj finally , the character of the fiancé 's friend ( ? ) i found very disturbing and unreal . xxmaj he looked like xxmaj harold xxmaj lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else . xxmaj as he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about , his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean - spirited . xxmaj were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused ? xxmaj this seems to me that 's what is implied and i do n't like it at all . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj there are xxup far better xxmaj french films of the era ( xxmaj le xxmaj million , xxmaj la xxmaj femme du xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj fanny , xxmaj regain , and others ) as well as better silent films . i just ca n't understand this film 's high rating .,xxbos xxmaj luise xxmaj rainer received an xxmaj oscar for her performance in xxmaj the xxmaj good xxmaj earth . xxmaj unfortunately , her role required no . xxmaj she did not say much and looked pale throughout the film . xxmaj luise 's character was a slave then given away to marriage to xxmaj paul xxmaj muni 's character ( he did a fantastic job for his performance ) . xxmaj set in ancient xxmaj asia , both actors were not xxmaj asian , but were very convincing in their roles . i hope that xxmaj paul xxmaj muni received an xxmaj oscar for his performance , because that is what xxmaj luise must have gotten her xxmaj oscar for . xxmaj she must have been a breakthrough actress , one of the first to method act . xxmaj this seems like something that xxmaj hollywood does often . xxmaj al xxmaj pacino has played an xxmaj italian and xxmaj cuban . i felt xxmaj luise 's performance to be lackluster throughout , and when she died , she did not change in expression from any previous scenes . xxmaj she stayed the same throughout the film ; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice . xxmaj if her brilliant acting was so subtle , i suppose i did not see it .\n",
